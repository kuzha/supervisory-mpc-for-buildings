# Supervisory Model Predictive Control for Buildings
Model predictive control (MPC) is a very promising control approach for energy
efficiency and demand response for building systems. This repository includes
example files for co-simulation between TRNSYS and Matlab.

If you are a building energy modeller who is not yet familiar with MPC, this
repository is a good start for you to try out MPC simulations for buildings. A
simple supervisory control scheme is used with a detailed building (white box)
model in TRNSYS and a Resistance-Capacitance (grey box) model in the controller
realized in Matlab.
